Hice una mudanza de Dallas a San Antonio, en donde bajé todos los asientos y venían mis dos perras, dos televisiones, cajas, venía hasta el tope el mini y digo la verdad es que es algo inusual porque uno esperaría que para ese tipo de mudanzas uno utilizara alguna camioneta, algún camión rentado, pero en el mini en verdad logro hacer cosas que son inusuales."," Well, people don't believe me when I tell them how much I can fit in the Mini. I made a move from Dallas to San Antonio, where I lowered all the seats and my two dogs came, two televisions, boxes, the mini came to the top and I tell the truth is that it is something unusual because one would expect that for that type of removal You will use a van, a rented truck, but in the mini I really manage to do things that are unusual.",=HYPERLINK("https://client.instapanel.com/panels/304c4e90-4f43-488b-a518-6fd7bedabde5/responses/64b2e41507f02e6d1e7f9db8/subtasks/64adb74f5b4c712ad18ff164"),=HYPERLINK("https://com-instapanel-video.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/b95ebdf6-1d07-43eb-a769-f980f8156f16.mp4")," Music accompanies, Create memories, Children, Takes advantage of the trip, Popular Idols, Talk"," Cuando estoy solo en mi carro. Me encanta escuchar música cuando estoy con gente en mi carro, me encanta platicar porque pues la música me acompaña, es parte de mi, mis gustos, mis recuerdos y cuando voy con compañía pues los estoy creando. Básicamente es el el aprovechar el viaje y no nada más el destino. Cuando voy con mis hijos. Cada parte es oportunidad de aprendizaje y demás, de enseñarles, de platicar, de saber qué es lo que piensan, porque pues finalmente pasamos mucho tiempo en nuestros carros, se vuelven como una segunda casa creo yo."," When I'm alone in my car. I love listening to music when I'm with people in my car, I love talking because music accompanies me, it's part of me, my tastes, my memories and when I'm with company, I'm creating them. Basically it is taking advantage of the trip and not just the destination. When I go with my children. Each part is an opportunity to learn and so on, to teach them, to talk, to find out what they think, because after all, we spend a lot of time in our cars, I think they become like a second home.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
